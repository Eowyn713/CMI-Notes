# Matching Problem
---
$G=(V,E)$
$M\subseteq E$ is a matching if no two edges in $M$ share an endpoint.

$M$ matching
An *alternating path* wrt $M$ in $G$ is a path that alternates between edges of $M$ and edges of $E\setminus M$.
An *augmenting path* is an alternating path $P$ that begins and ends in a vertex not matched in $M$. $|M\oplus P|=|M|+1$.
