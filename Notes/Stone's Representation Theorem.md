#  Stone's Representation Theorem
---
### Theorem:
For every boolean algebra is isomorphic to a field of sets.
###  Proof:

---
### Theorem:
$\varphi$ is a classical tautology iff $\mathbb B\models \varphi$ for all [[Boolean Algebra|Boolean Algebras]] $\mathcal B$

### Proof:
Left to right is by definition
Right to left:
suppose $\mathcal B\not\models\varphi$ for some $\mathcal B$.
$\mathcal B$ is isomorphic to a field of sets using **Stone's representation Theorem**
