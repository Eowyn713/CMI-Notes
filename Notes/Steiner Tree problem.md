# Steiner Tree problem

$G=(V,E)$,
costs $c_{uv}\leq 0$ $\forall(u,v)\in E$,
two types of vertices: required and Steiner

**Goal:** To find a min-cost subset $T \subset E$ st $T$ is a tree that includes all required vertices and any subset of Steiner vertices.

- **Lemma:** Any approximation for metric case $\implies$ the same approximation for non metric case
