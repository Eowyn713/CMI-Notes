# Non deterministic Space Hierarchy Theorem
---
If $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \frac{S_{1}(n)}{S_{2}(n)}=0$, and $S_{2}(n)$ is fully space constructible, then $NSPACE(S_{1}(n))\subsetneq NSPACE(S_{2}(n))$.
*Proof:*
Look at all nondet machines $M_{1},M_{2},\dots$, and their complements (the machine that accepts the complement of that language), $\overline{M_{1}},\overline{M_{2}},\dots$ and diagonalise against all of them. (??)
