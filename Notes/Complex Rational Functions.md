# Complex Rational Functions
Let 
$$
R(z)=\frac {P(z)} {Q(z)}
$$
be in its lowest term where $P,Q$ are [[Complex Polynomials]].
We may give $R(z)$ the value $\infty$ whenever $Q(z)=0$.
Then $R(z):\mathbb C\to S$ is continmuous.

A point where $Q(z)$ has a zero is called a **pole** of if $R(z)$. Its order is the order of $a$ as a root of $Q(z)$

For greater unity, consider a map 
$R: S\to S$ and let $R_1(z)=R(\frac1z)$ 
then $R(\infty) = R_1(0)$
If $R_1(0) = 0$ or $\infty$ , then the order of the zero or pole at $\infty$ is defined as the order of the zero or pole of $R_1(z)$ at $0$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Say } R(z) &= {a_0 + a_1z+\cdots+a_nz^n\over b_0+b_1z+\cdots+b_mz^m}\\
R_1(z) &= z^{m-n}{a_0z^n + a_1z^{n-1}+\cdots+a_n\over b_0z^m+b_1z^{m-1}+\cdots+b_m}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
If $m>n$,  $R(z)$ has a zero of order $m-n$ at $\infty$; if $m<n$, $R(z)$ has a pole of $n-m$ at $\infty$.
