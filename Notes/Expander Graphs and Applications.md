> A complete graph has the first two properties, but not the last two. *Expander graphs* exhibit all these properties, and thus turn out be very useful. They are a very good approximation of a complete graph. In this course, we will study them in detail, and see a lot of applications.

Expander graphs are super useful. They help in:
- Derandomisation of randomised algorithms
- Error reduction in randomised algorithms

In addition to that, we will be looking at their application in:
- Circuit complexity
- Error correcting codes
- Counting
- Space complexity
- [[Probabilistically Checkable Proof]]
