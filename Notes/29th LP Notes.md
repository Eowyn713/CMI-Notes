- Geometric Interpretation
	- All constraints are intersection of closed half spaces(N dimensional spaces cut by an n-1 dimensional hyperplane)
	- Intersection of these things would be a closed convex polyhedron
	- If we pick a point at the edge, we can only move in one direction.
	- Tableau pivoting is moving along an edge
- Bland's Pivoting rule
	- with multiple choices, take the one with the smallest index
- Proof of termination
