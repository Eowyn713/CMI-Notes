title:definition

A distributive lattice with $0$ and $1$ such that for all $a, b\in H$ we have $a\implies b\in H$
```

^20491c

Here the "Implies" is shorthand notation which means: 
	There exists a largest $c$ such that $a\sqcap c\le b$
	$\sim a:= a\implies 0$

$(\theta(\mathbb R),\cup,\cap,\implies,\emptyset,\mathbb R)$
where $A\implies B=\text{Int}(-A\cup B)$
$\sim A=\text{Int}(-A)$
