\begin{align}
\text{Val}(pXq, n)\ =\ &\text{true}
\begin{cases}
\text{There is a run $(p, X) \to (q, X)$ of length $\leq n$}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
$$
Something something
$pXq$ is valid  if $\exists i$ such that $\text{Val}(pXq, i)$ is $\top$.

hmmmmmmm,,, ): I need to fix this lecture stuff.


I am also hungry, I missed breakfast
