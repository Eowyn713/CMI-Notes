# Intuitionistic Logic

$2+5 = 3\times6$

The logic interpretation was first developed as BHK - Interpretation which stands for Brouwer, Heyting and Kolmogorov which probably independently made contributions to it.

```ad-note
title: syntax
The Main syntax of the language of intuitionistic logic is
$$
\begin{matrix}\perp & | & (\phi\to\psi) & | & (\phi\land\psi) & | & (\phi\lor\psi)\end{matrix}
$$
along with short hand notations
$$
\begin{align*}
\lnot \phi &= (\phi\to\perp)\\
\phi\leftrightarrow\psi &= (\phi\to\psi)\land(\psi\to\phi)\\
\top &= \perp\to\perp\\
\end{align*}
$$
```

The language of Intuitionistic Logic was later simplified in a language called [[Natural Deduction]]
