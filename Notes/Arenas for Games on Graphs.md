# Arenas for Games on Graphs
---
We define di-graphs (possibly infinite) as the *Arena* we will play game on.

We shall partition the node into 2 sets $V_R$ and $V_S$, So the arena is defined as followed.

>[!definition] Arena
>$$
>A = \langle V, E\rangle
>$$
>Where $V = V_R\sqcup V_S$ and $E\in V\times V$

The idea behind dividing $V$ into $V_R$ and $V_S$ is that, if the "current position" in the play is $V_R$ then Rajnikant will pick the next move, otherwise Sreevani will pick the move.
