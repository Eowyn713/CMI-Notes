# Arenas for Games on Graphs
---
We define di-graphs (possibly infinite) as the *Arena* we will play game on.

We shall partition the node into 2 sets $V_E$ and $V_A$, So the arena is defined as followed.

>[!definition] Arena
>$$
>A = \langle V, E\rangle
>$$
>Where $V = V_E\sqcup V_A$ and $E\in V\times V$


The idea behind dividing $V$ into $V_E$ and $V_A$ is that, if the "current position" in the play is $V_E$ then Elster (represented by $\bigcirc$) will pick the next move, otherwise Adler (represented by $\square$) will pick the move.
