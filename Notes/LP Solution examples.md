#  LP Solution examples

1. Simple:
   Maximize $4x_1-x_2$ subject to the constraint $x_1+x_2=5$ where both variables are positive.

2. Unbounded Cost:
   Maximize $x_1$ to the constraint $x_1 - x_2 = 5$ where both variables are positive.

3. Unbounded Region:
   Maximize $x_1-x_{2}$ to the constraint $x_1-x_{2}=5$ where both variables are positive.

There are infinitely many points in the *feasible region* but all points have cost *5*, hence all of then are optimum.
4. More dimensions
   Maximize $x_{1}-5x_{2}+4x_{3}$ under the constraint $x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}=1$ and all variables positive.

   The point $(0,0,1)$ is the optimum.
