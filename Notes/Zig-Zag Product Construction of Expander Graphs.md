# Zig-Zag Product Construction of Expander Graphs
---
> [!cite] This construction is due to Reingold, Vadhan, Wigderson. It is not the best possible construction in terms of the spectral graphs, but it is the best known combinatorial construction.

Spectrum of the tensor matrix of two matrices, is the product of the spectra of the two matrices.

We want to define $G-zig-zag-H$, where $G=(N,D,\lambda_{G})$, $H=(D,d,\lambda_{H})$.
First we replace each vertex in $G$ by a cloud, which is sort of a copy of $H$.
From each cloud $C_{u}$,
