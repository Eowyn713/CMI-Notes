# Gameplay for Games on Graphs
---
The games starts it a designated start node of the arena, where we keep a token in it. 

Say we are currently at vertex $v$

- If $v\in V_E$ then Elster will pick one of the out-neighbours of the $v$ and move the token to that vertex.
- If $v\in V_A$ the Adler does the same.

The game will either continue indefinitely, or until a vertex is reached with no out-neighbours.
