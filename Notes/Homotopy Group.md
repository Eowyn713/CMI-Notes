# Homotopy Group
---

*Homotopy Groups* are a tool used to classify [[Topological Spaces]] based on the number and type of "holes" in the space.

>[!definition] $n^\text{th}$ Homotopy Group $\Pi_n$
>The $n^\text{th}$ Homotopy Group is the set of functions from $S^n$ with a base point to a topological space with a base point. These functions form a group where the group operation corresponds to "concatenation" of these function. And the constant function acts as the identity element of the group.

So the $n^\text{th}$ Homotopy group talks about the number of holes of size up to $n$.

The first Homotopy group is also called the [[Fundamental Group]]
