- Model Checking of LTL on Buchi automata
	- Bm internsection B(not phi) should be empty
- Types of property
	- Safety : Nothing Bad happens
		- if the property fails at some position and then is never true. after that
		- bad thing should be identifiable as a discrete event
	- Liveness : if you wait long enough, something good is going to happen
		- for every finite trace, we can extend it to an infinite state tath satisfies the property
