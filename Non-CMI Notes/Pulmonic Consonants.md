# Pulmonic Consonants
A **Pulmonic Consonant** is a consonant made by obstructing the [[Glottis|glottis]](space between vocal chords) or the oral cavity.

All consonants in English fall into this category.
The **Pulmonic Consonant** table, which includes most consonants is arranged in rows that designate [[Some Definitions#^MannerOfArticulatiion|manner of articulation]] and columns that designate [[Some Definitions#^PlaceOfArticulation|place of articulation]]. Main chart only includes consonants with a single place of articulation

The only other thing that is required to identify a consonant is the *voicing*
```ad-note
Figuring out a consonant is like asking about a party
- where (place of articulation)
- how (manner of articulation)
- what are the vibes (voicing)
```

- The letters that appear in pairs, are pairs of voiced(right) and unvoiced(left) consonant that have the same configuration. These are the ones that involve obstructing airflow.
- Empty white areas are sounds that are technically possible to produce but are not found in any recognized language. The IPA is amended to add such sounds if found.
- The shaded areas are theoretically impossible due to biological limitations.
