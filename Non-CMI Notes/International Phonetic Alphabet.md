# International Phonetic Alphabet
The **International Phonetic Alphabet** is an alphabetic notation of sounds primarily written in _Latin Script_. It was devised by the *international Phonetic Association* In late 19th century.
- It does not use combinations of letters to produce a single sound, like `sh` or `th` in English.
- There are no letters that have context dependent sounds, like `a` in `smart` and `drake` in English.
- Does not usually have two letters for the same sound.

The alphabet is designed to be intuitive for people to speak some of the European languages.

The **IPA** has divided the letters in to mainly the following 3 categories:
- [[Pulmonic Consonants]]
- [[Non-Pulmonic Consonants]]
- [[Vowels]]
