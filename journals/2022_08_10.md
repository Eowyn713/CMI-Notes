- # ALGO
	- In case of inductive arguments, make sure all cases can be reached from the base case, one way this can be done is by moving backwards to make induction step.
	- Algorithms may not take time which is a monotonically increasing function of the size of the input
	- ### Sorting
		- __Input:__ $A[0,1,2,3\dots(n-1)]$, array of Integer
		- __Output__: $B[0,1,2,3\dots(n-1)]$, a permutation of the elements of $A$ in non decreasing order.
		- A __Loop Invariant__ is a statement that satisfies
			- Initialization: Holds true before the first iteration
			- Maintenance: If ti holds immediately before one iteration, then it also holds immediately before the next iteration
			- Termination: Immediately after control exits the loop, the fact that the statement is a loop invariant gives us some useful property of the algorithm
		- ##### Insertion Sort
		  ```
		  insertion_sort(A)
		      I=1
		  	while I <= N-1:
		  		next = A[I]
		      	J = I-1
		      	while J >= 0 and (A[J] > next):
		      		A[J+1] = A[J]
		          	J -= 1
		      	A[J+1] = next
		      	I += 1
		  	return A
		  ```
		- for the outer while loop:
			- _Inv:_ The current array prefix `A[0,1,...(i-1)]` is a sorted version of the original array prefix `A[0,1,...,(i-1)]`
			- _Main:_ I before this iteration $i_1$ we have `A[0,1,...,i-1]` and after the iteration we have `A[0,1,...,i]`
