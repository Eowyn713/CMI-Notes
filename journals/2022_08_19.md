	- Let $F, G:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{D}$, A __Natural Transformation__ $\eta:F\implies G$ is a tuple $(\eta_C: F_C \to G_C)_{C\in\mathbb{C}}$ such that for every $h:c\to c'\in\mathbb{C}$ The following diagram commutes
	- __Eg:__ $G\to G/N$
		- let $Grp^{(2)}$ be $(G, N)$ such that $N \lhd G$
		- we have 2 functors, the first being $(G, N) \to G$, $(G, N) \to G / N$
		- let $h: (G_1, N_1) \to (G_2, N_2)$
	- __Eg:__ $\mathbb{Z} \to R \in CRing$
		- take the functor which takes a homomorphism from $Z$ and the other is the identity functor.
	- __Eg:__ $S\times T \to S$
	- __Eg:__ $GL_n(R) \to R^*$
	- __Eg:__ Identity Natural Transformation
	- __Eg:__ $C_1 \implies C_2$
		- $C_1, C_2: * \to \mathbb{C}$
		- $C_1\implies C_2$ is just the morphism $C_1\to C_2$
	- __Def:__ $\mathbb{C},\mathbb{D}$ be two categories, let $\mathbb{D}^{\mathbb{C}}$ is a category where the objects are functors between the categories and the morphisms are Natrual transformations between the functors
