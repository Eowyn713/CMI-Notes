		- Categories for the working mathematician (Mac Lane)
		- Category Theory in context (Richl)
	- $f : X \to Y$ as compared to $f(X)\sub Y$, this notation came up in the 1940s
	- A __Category__ $\mathbb{C}$ is the following data
		- It has $2$ sets, the set of objects ($Ob(\mathbb{C})$), the set of morphisms ($Mor(\mathbb{C})$)
		- 2 functions, dom(domain), cod(codomain) : M -> O
		  for any pair of functions $f, g$, they are said be composable if $cod\ f = dom\ g$
		- For every composable pair of morphisms $f$ and $g$, there is a morphism $gf = g\circ f$ such that $dom\ gf = dom f$ and $cod\ gf = cod\ g$
		- For every object $c\in O$, $\exists$ a morphism $id_c$ such that $dom\ id_c = cod\ id_c =  c$
		- Composition is associative
	- A category is a place where diagrams live
	- __Eg:__ Sets
		- $Ob(Set) =$ set of all sets
		- $Mor(Set) =$ set of functions
	- __Eg:__ Grp, Top(topological spaces), Cring(commutative Rings), Ring
		- $Ob(Grp) =$ set of all group
		- $Mor(Set) =$ set of homomorphism
	- __Eg:__ let $G$ be a group, make $BG$
		- $Ob(BG) = \{\cdot\}$
		- $Mor(BG) = G$
	- __Eg:__ Given a category $\mathbb{C}$, define $\mathbb{C}^{op}$
		- $Ob(\mathbb{C}^{op}) =Ob(\mathbb{C})$
		- $Mor(\mathbb{C}^{op}) =Mor(\mathbb{C})$
		- $dom\ \mathbb{C}^{op} = cod\ \mathbb{C}$
		- $cod\ \mathbb{C}^{op} = dom\ \mathbb{C}$
		- informally: The same category but with reversed morphisms
	- A morphism $f: X\to Y$ in $\mathbb{C}$ is called an __isomorphism__ if there exists a morphism $g:Y\to X$ such that $f\circ g= id_Y$ and $g\circ f = id_X$
	- A __Groupoid__ is a category where all the morphisms are isomorphisms
	- A left (or right) cancellable morphism is called monic(epic)
		- In sets monics are injective maps and epics are surjective maps
	- if a morphism has a left inverse, it is called split monic
	- __Theorem__: if a morphism $f$ is monic and split epic, then it is invertible
		- $$\begin{aligned}fg &= id\\
		  fgf &= f\\
		  \implies gf &= id\end{aligned}$$
