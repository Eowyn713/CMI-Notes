	- $S$ is jordan measurable if $S$ is bounded and $\partial S$ has measure or content $0$
	- __"Fubini" Theorem__(integration over product rectangles as iterated integrals)
		- let $R\sub\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ be a rectangle, let $f$ be a Riemann integrable function on $R$. For $x\in A$ define $fr_x:B\to R$ by $fr_x(y) = f(x, y)$. Let $L$ and $U$ be functions on $A$ defined by $$\\L(x)=\int\limits_Bfr_x(y)dy=\sup L(P_B, fr_x)\\U(x)=\int\limits_Bfr_x(y)dy=\inf U(P_B, fr_x)\\$$ Then $L$ and $U$ are integrable on $A$ and their integral is the value of the integral of $f$ in $R$.sh
