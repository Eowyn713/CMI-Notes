	- ### Natural Transformation
	- Canonical maps from Set -> Set is just the identity map
	- Canonical maps from $Grp \to Grp$ is the $id$ map and the zero map
	- Canonical map from $Ab \to Ab$ are $id$ and zero map and $inv$
	- __Eg__ $Hom(1, S) \to S$
		- $f\mapsto f(1)$
	- __Def:__ A Natural Isomorphism $\eta$ is a natural transformation with all components invertible
	- _Principle of natural isomorphism:_ We shouldn't talk about no isomorphism invariant properties of functors
	- __Def:__ $F: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{D}$ is an equivalence if it is essentially invertible.
		- $\exists G:\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{G}$ such that
		- $FG\cong I_\mathbb{D}$
		- $GF\cong I_\mathbb{C}$
	- __Def:__ $Skel(\mathbb{C})\sub \mathbb{C}$ where you choose $1$ object from each isomorphism class of $\mathbb{C}$ and all morphisms between them.
	- __Thm:__ $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{D}$ is an equivalence $\iff$ $Skel(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{D}\to Skel(\mathbb{D})$ is an isomorphism
