- # Category Theory
	- ### Universal Properties
	- As math gets more complicated, the constructions will get more complicated, to motivate this
		- Make a construction
		- Use that as a definition
		- Find properties of the construction
		- make theory based on the construction
	- To make this better
		- make the properties the definition
		- build the theory for the properties
		- construction will be proof of existence of the properties
	- $R: \mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{C}$. A morphism from $C$ to $R$ is a pair($d, f: c\to Rd$)
	- $R: \mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{C}$. A universal morphism ($Lc, u_c: c\to RLc$) from $c$ to $R$ such that for any ($d, f: c\to Rd$) $\exists ! f :Lc \to d$ such that $(Rg)\circ u_c = f$
