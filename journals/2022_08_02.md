	- $(X, d)$ is a metric space. Let $x \in X$, then a <u>neighborhood</u> $B(x) = \{y\in X | d(x, y) < r \}$
	- $x\in X$ is a <u>limit point</u> of a subset $E \sub X$ if any neighborhood $B(x), r>0$ contains a point $p\in E$ not equal to $x$
	- A subset $E\in X$ is said to be <u>closed</u> if $E$ contains all its limit points
	- A point $x\in X$ is said to be <u>isolated</u> in $X$ if $\exists$ a neighborhood of $x$ that does not contain any point of $X$ other than $x$
	- Space $E\sub X$ and $x\in X$, we say that $x$ is an <u>interior point</u> of $E$ if $\exists$ a neighborhood $B_r(x) \sub E$
	- A subset $E$ of $X$ is said to be <u>open</u> if every point in $E$ is an interior point
		- A set $E$ is open $\iff E^C$ is closed
		- if $E$ is not open then $\exists x\in E$ such that $x_n\to x$ such that $x_n \in E^C$. Then $x \not\in Int(E)$
	- A set $E$ is <u>perfect</u> in $X$ if $E$ is closed and every point of $E$ is a limit point of $E$
	- A set $E\sub X$ is said to be <u>bounded</u> if for a point $p\in E$, the neighborhood $B_R(p)$ for some large $R$ contains the set $E$
	- $E\sub X$, let $E'$ be the set of limit point of $E$ then $\overline{E} = E\cup E'$ is called the <u>closure</u> of $E$
		- A set $E$ is closed $\iff E = \overline{E}$
		- if $F$ is a closed set and $E\sub F \implies \overline{E} \sub F$
		- if $E\sub X$ and $E$ is bounded, then $\sup(E) \in \overline{E}$
	- $(X, d)$ is a metric space, then it is <u> Hausdorff </u> / $T_2$ if for any $2$ points in in $x, y\in X$, we can find open neighborhoods for $x, y$ such that they do not intersect.
	- $(X, d)$ is a metric space, then a subset $E$ is said to be <u>compact</u> if every open cover of $E$ contains a finite subcover:w
- # Algo
	- An __Algorithm__ is a series of steps that take inputs and return outputs, which have some predefined connection to the inputs
	- __Properties__ :=
		- Input: There should be $0$ or more inputs which belong to a well defined set.
		- Output: The algorithm returns $0$ or more outputs that must belong to a well defined set.
		- Finiteness: Runs a finite amount of time.
		- Definiteness: Each step is well defined
		- Effectiveness: Each step is sufficiently well described that it, in principle, can be executed using pen and paper
	- __Euclidian Division__
		- The input should be a non negative integer and an integer
		- The output is the quotient and remainder received when we divide the first input by the second.
		- Both inputs should be binary number
		- $X = Q \times Y + R$
		  $0 \leq R < Y$
		- ```
		  divide(X, Y):
		  	if X == 0: return (0, 0)
		      Z = floor(X/2)
		      (Q, R) = divide (Z, Y)
		      (Q, R) = (2 * Q, 2 * R)
		      if X is odd:
		      	R = R+1
		      if R >= Y:
		      	R = R - Y
		          Q = Q + 1
		      return (Q, R)
		  ```
