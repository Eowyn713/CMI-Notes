# Welfare Maximisation - Provisioning Public Projects (Manisha Padala)
(Aditi)
- Centralised crowdfunding
	- People want to fund several projects, which to actually go ahead with?
	- So they vote
	- Central something decides based on votes or bribes or smth
	- Of course, we have to let the dumbos and the non cooperators enjoy those projects as well.
	- Examples of actual people in the actual world having funded actual projects: Wooden pedestrian bridge in Rotterdam, One belt one road Chinese nonsense
- Decentralised crowdfunding
	- People come to some platform, pick what they feel like spending money on today, and voluntarily choose to do so
- "Assume agents are saints"
