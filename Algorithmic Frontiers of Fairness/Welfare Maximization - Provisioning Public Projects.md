# Welfare Maximisation - Provisioning Public Projects - Manisha Padala
- Motivation
	- modelling crowed funding
		- getting people together to come to a concensus
			- Wooden pedestrian bridge in Rotterdam
			- One belt one Road
		- sounds kinda similar to resource allocation differences being
			- non-rivalrous
				- everyone gets something 
			- non-excludable
				- we cannot exclude people who did not contribute
- Problem setting
	- Centralised
		- People vote for preferred projects
		- Aggregate their votes to find a desirable subset of projects
		- Specify each Agent's contribution
			- each agent comes with a budget and cannot contribute more than that, so the central budget must be at most total crowd budget
			- The entire money pool comes from the agents
			- Agents care about where their money is used
	- Decentralised
		- Agents arrive at a platform
		- realize the valuations for each project
		- voluntarily contribute
		- Public projects are non-executable
		- no incentive to contribute - free riding is a thing
		- Must have refunds
- Centralised - truthful agents
	- $N=[n]$ agents
	- budget $b_i$ and $B$ is their sum
	- $M=[m]$ project 
	- cost $C_{j}$ of projects
	- valuation $v_{ij}$, value of a project $j$ by agent $i$
	- We maximize sum of utility such that the budget constraints are met and each agent has non zero utility
	- Results
		- No poly time approx 
		- no poly time approx for identical cost setting
		- admits and FPTAS when agents are laminar single minded
		- UWU_WP (UWO-WP)
- Decentralised - strategic agent
	- $N=[n]$ agents
	- budget $b_i$ and $B$ is their sum
	- $M=[m]$ project 
	- cost $C_{j}$ of projects
	- valuation $v_{ij}$, value of a project $j$ by agent $i$
	- A bonus $\mathcal B$. its the extra stuff that the event organiser adds to incentivize others
	- Incentive structure: they want their own profit to get maximized.
	- Bonus scheme
		- project if funded agent gets $v_i-x_i$
		- project does not get funded, the agent gets a fraction of the bonus back corresponding to the amount they pair along with $x_i$ that they paid
- Summary
	- Bounded approx for uwo-wp in single mided setting is open
	- restrictions that by pass inapproxability
