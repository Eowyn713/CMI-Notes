# Fair Division via Quantile Shares
(Shubh)
- Problem - Fair division of Indivisible Items/chores
- Fair Shares - proportionality and Maxmin shares
	- $m$ items
	- $n$ agents with monotone valuation
	- Agent does not care about other agent's share
- A share is feasable if for every profile of valuation, there is some allocation for every valuation
- Maxmin share 
	- Maxmin share, one person cuts and gets his lowest part, it is infeasable
	- Constant fraction of maximum share $\frac{3}{4}$ is feasable for additive
	- Some constant fractoins are feasible for submodular
	- no constant fraction is feasible for general monotone valuations
- proportional share
	- no fraction of the proportional share is feasible
- *Quantile Share*
	- Consider an agent who believes that the allocation of items will be done uniformly at random. Idea is to use this as a benchmark for fairness
	- Agent asks "What is the prob that my bundle is worse in a uniformly random allocation is weakly worse than the bundle I receive" 
	- An allocation is $q-fair$ if this probability is atleast $q$ for all $i$
	- this is infeasible for $q>\frac{1}{e}$
	- $q\leq \frac{1}{2e}$, then it is always feasible if rainbow erdos mathcing conjecture is true
	- for $q < \frac{0.14}{e}$ then this is feasible for Additive valuations
	- for $q= \frac{1}{e}$ is the critical balue between feasibility and infeasibility.
- Quantile share and veto lists
	- Every agent submits a veto list of atmost size $L$ of allocations
	- what is the largest $L$ such that the allocator can always pick an allocation which is not in any of the veto list
	- For all $n-tuples$ od monotone consistent veto list of size $l>\frac{1}{2e}$ aaa
