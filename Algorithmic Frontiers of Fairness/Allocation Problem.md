# Allocation Problem
---

Given:
- A set $[n]$ of $n$ agents
- A set $[m]$ of $m$ indivisible goods
- A valuation function $v_i:2^{[m]}\to\mathbb R^+$ where empty set maps to $0$.

## Welfare
*Maximum Nash Welfare:* $\max\big(\prod_i v_i(X_i)\big)^{\frac 1 n}$ 
- Interesting tradeoff between efficiency and fairness.
- Motivated by Nash bargaining
- Scale free: invariant under 
- This is a very hard problem *NP-hard*.
