# Matching with fairness constraints
(Shubh)
- Input
	- A set of Items
	- A set of platform
	- Platforms have quota
	- Platforms define classes of items
	- Classes have quota
	- Classes are subsets of neighborhoods
	- Classes define fairness constraints
- Goal: Match maximum number of items to platforms
- Some natural examples
	- Committee - needs to have experts of all areas. Justifies why every platform has its own class
	- Projects - wasteful to have many employees with the same skill. studied previously for clustering and stuff
- Polytime Algorithm for laminar classes
	- Classes do not have non trivial intersection - disjoint or containment
	- Maximum matching in laminar classes reduces to max flow
		- maximum matching in $G \Leftrightarrow$ max flow in $H$
- There is a reductoin from independent set.
	- take a graph, add a node to it which represents a platform and connect all nodes
	- Then make 2 adjaced edges in the og graphs a part of a single class with quota 1
	- This means that even the 1 platform case is NP-Hard
- $\frac{1}{2}$ approximation for $O(1)$ classes
	- One platform => exact algorithm by solving integer linear program
	- say we have $\Delta$ classes, so for the nodes we define types which are just set of classes they are in, so we hvae $2^{\Delta}$ classes, we make a variable for each and do ILP somehow
	- $\alpha$ approximation for 1 platform, gives $\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}$ approximatoin
	- Find, $\alpha$ approximation for each platform from remaining items
		- ???????????? 
	- If the number of classes is not known, but each item is contained in atleast $\Delta$ many classes, by the greedy algorithm, we get $\frac{\Delta}{1+\Delta}$ approximation
- Connection with Hypergraph Independent Set
	- strong independent set we get a $\frac{1}{\Delta}$ approx
	- weak independent set we get a $\frac{\log\Delta}{\Delta \log \log\Delta}$ approx
- Proportional bounds
	- For $M(p) = \alpha$ many items bound to the class, we want  to allocate $a|\alpha|$ and $b|\alpha|$
	- For disjoint classes $O(l)$ approx takes $O(n^{2})$ time.
- Future Direction
	- extending proportional fairness for non-disjoint classes
	- Incorporate item/platfrom preferences
