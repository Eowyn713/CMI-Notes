# Fairly Allocating Goods, Chores and Mixed - Ruta Mehta
- Intro
	- Chores appear in our daily life as frequently as goods, so chore allocation is just as important as allocating goods
	- we want to allocate both chores(negative) and goods(positive) and have a fair division
	- Assets vs liability and defence budgets vs duties is another example
- Model
	- A set of $n$ agents
	- A set of $m$ divisible items
- Competitive (market) Equilibrium *CE*
	- Optimal bundle refers to whatever the agents want to buy disregarding the supply constraints
	- The collection of optimal bundle is demand
	- and CE is when demand = supply
	- CEEI (CE equal income) is when all agents have the same budget
		- This is envy free and everything is allocated
		- Also we can get pareto optimal and nash welfare for a wide range of functions
		- This only words when items are divisible.
	- Computation of CE is extremely important apparently
- CE with Bads/Chores
	- Prices are now payments
	- Agents have earning requirements
	- both the things together you we have a bundle 
	- bundles together create a demand and now we minimise pain instead of maximising uhh happy and CE is when we have demand = supply
	- Equal budget corresponds to equal income
- 1-homogeneous
	- value of a scaled bundle is the same as scaled value of the bundle
	- Even with CEEI with additive vals, bad only does not give a non convex set.
	- With number of agents and number of items is a constant, we have poly time algorithm
- Approximation Algorithm - exterior point method
	- Bads W linear
		- A: set of agents who need to earn atleast 1 and linear valuation
		- M; set of $m$ divisible bad chores
		- feasable means demand = supply
		- Nash Welfare: Minimize the product of disutilities given the constraint that every variable is positive
		- But this is not a convex set so we only go after a local optima as global optima would be hard to find
		- Local optima condition is normal to the tangent hyperplane is equal to the gradient
		- Naive idea: gradient descent, always goes to the boundry where it should not go. because that is where the minima is but we disqualify it by extra constraints
		- Idea: Pick a point $e$ in the exterior, go to the closest point.
		- Then we go the nearest valid point.
		- Then we move along the tangent hyperplane and find the best point in it. this will likely be another exterior point but it will be objectively beter.
		- If we converge we are sure that we are at a solution and we converge in polynomial time.
