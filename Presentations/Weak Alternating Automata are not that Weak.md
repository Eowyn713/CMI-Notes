- Do the true - false transition thingy
- Section 2 - WAA
	- WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	- Mention the true false thingy for alternating automa
- Section 3 - rank thingy
	- Relation of Alternating Automata with games
	- Mention that for $\langle q, i\rangle$ q cannot be alpha state and odd rank.
	- remember to mention that we are working with accepting runs
- Section 4 Co - Buchi Alt to WAA
	- description
		- given intuition for ranks as partial order
		- release - before $Q'$
		- Good set  are the same as odd rank thingies - better.
	- Informal Proof of correctness
	- Buchi to WAA :$A_B$ to $A_C$ by complementing, then to $W$ then complement $W$ 
	- Improving construction
	- minimal rank slides
	- Do theorem 4.6 before theorem 4.5
- Sectio
	- Buchi to NBA:  
		- description 
			- ( diagram for understanding the intuition)
			- before  n 5 Complementing Buchi
	- Buchi to NBA: $A_{b}\to N$ 
		- description 
			- ( diagram for understanding the intuition)
			- $O \neq \emptyset$ before $O = \emptyset$  
	- NBA complementation
	- optimal construction
		-  define consistent 
		-  claim for $2^{(n\log n)}$
		- definition of construction 
- Notation
	- Weak Alternating Automata - $W$
	- Alternating Co Buchi - $A_C$
	- Alternating  Buchi - $A_B$
	- Non Determinisitc Buchi - $N$
	- Optimal WAA - $W_j$
