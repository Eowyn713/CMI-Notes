A Repository of notes of CMI courses and more!

These notes were taken in [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). Which is a Zettlekasten based note taking app.

**ALERT:**
Plugins required to view some files:
- Admonition ( for callouts in old notes )
- Excalidraw ( for a ton of hand draws diagrams )
- TikZJax ( for Commutative Diagrams somewhere )
