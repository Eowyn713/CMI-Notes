# From Concept Learning to SAT-Based Invariant Inference - Sharon Shoham

- Safety Verification
	- No null derefernces
	- No mutual exclusion violation
	- No consensus violation
	- $\cdots$
- We have a module over Integer
	- Initial state is $\langle 0,0,0,0\dots 0\rangle$ : $\mathbb N^n$
	- The operation takes 2 inputs $\alpha$ and $\beta$  and does $(\alpha+2\cdot\beta\mod n)$ 
	- Properties
		- Initiation: Should contain Initial state
		- Safety: does not intersect with the bad cases
		- Consecution: Closed under the transition operation
- Goal: Find inductive invariant automatically by employing a SAT solver
- Learning Model
	- Content
		- learning Algorithm - wants to learn an inductive invariant
		- Oracle - sat solver
	- Method
		- Learning Algorithm can ask Oracle some questions
		- Oracle replies with yes or no, and if no gives a counter example
		- Based on the answer, the learning algorithm comes up with new questions and figures out the stuff
- Query Model
	- Counter example is a state that takes you outside the invariant
	- Model based inference
		- If guess is not inductive, we check if adding it lets us go to the bad model, otherwise we weaken our invariant
	- Hoare-Query Model
		- Counter examples are traces
		- This is more efficient then inductiveness
- Complexity Lower and Upper Bounds
	- requires $2^{\Omega(n)}$ steps
	- Invariant also holds for monotonic case
- Invariant Inference is harder than concept learning
- We can derive complexity results for invariant inference from concept learning
