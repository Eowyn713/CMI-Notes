# A class of rational trace relations closed under composition - Dietrich Kuske
- Rational Languages 
	- construction from finite languages using
		- Union
		- concatenation
		- interation
	- These are nice because
		- There are many examples
		- Alternative characterizations
		- most of it is decidable
		- nice closure properties
	- applications
- Rational Relations or Rational Transductions
	- Its a binary relation on set of words, if it can be created with 
		- Union
		- concatenation
		- interation from finite relations
	- These are nice beacuse
		- Many e xamples
		- Alternate characterizations
		- nice closure properties
		- Right and left application preserves regularity (projections) give regular languagesrec 
		- Caucal '92
- Trace Monoid
	- Independence alphabet $(\Sigma, I)$ where $I$ is a symmetric
	- We say two words are congruent if we can transpose symmetric letters of the first word to get the second word
	- Tracy monoid is the set of words quotiented under the relation.
- Rational Trace relations
	- If you have a rational relation, replacing pairs of words with pairs of trace classes of words gets u a Rational Trace Relation.
	- has all nice properties as above but not composition
- Salvation
	- $R\subseteq \Gamma^* \times\Gamma^*$ is left closed if $\sim\circ R\subseteq R\circ\sim$
	- Closure Properties
		- Composition
		- Trace relations is rations iff it is a composition of inverse lc ration and lc rational
		- No inverse
		- left application of lc rational to recognizable is recognizable
	- Alternative charactersation
		- homomorphic images of regular languages
