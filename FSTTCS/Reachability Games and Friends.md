>When Patricia told me about the talk I had 3 challenges
>- First was that I need to prepare a talk which was understandable for students
>- second I wanted to make a talk where my colleagues would not get bored, So i had to talk about things from a perspective that they might not have explored
>- Third, and probably the most difficult challenge was that I had to prepare a talk that I would understand myself

- Train travel
	- there path from penzance to cambridge that goes through oxford, so If I want a path, then I would have to back track, so memory is important!
	- Homo oeconomicus
	- Types
		- Optimisitc
		- Pessimistic
		- Rational - Homo oeconomicus
		- Stochastic
- Focus of the talk - Memory and Complexity
- >[!note] Strategy
      > A strategy is the next move given a previous set of moves
	- If memory is finite it can be encoded in a finite state automata
	- sequential memory is required for generalized reachability problem
	- memory is classified by the size of mealy machine that encodes it
- Complexity
	- SAT can be encoded linearly in terms of the size of formula
- Memoryless strategies suffice for reachability in Zero-Sum Games
- Generalized Reachability is P-SPACE complete and requires branching memories.
