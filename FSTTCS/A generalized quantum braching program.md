# A generalized quantum branching program
- Classical Branching program
	- deterministic branching program
		- Size is the total number of nodes in the branching tree
		- length is the longest path from source to sink node
		- For a levelled graph, the width is the maximum number of nodes in any level
	- probabilistic branching programs
- Quantum branching program
	- Nakanashi's qbp
		- It is derived from the probabilistic branching program so you go to a node with an amplitude instead of a probability
	- Albayev's qbp
		- This uses something called a quantum transformation which is a tuple of state, and 2 evolution functoin
		- if input is 0 then apply 1 transformation program, if it is 1 then apply the other.
	- AQBP is too simple to have nice properties, NQBP is to complex to perform an analysis on
	- so we have generalized qbp
