	- let $f$ be a real valued function on $U\sub R^n$ then $f$ is locally integrable if for every point $r\in \mathbb{R}^n$, contains a closed rectangle $R_x\sub U$ such that $f|_R$ is integrable on $R$
	- __Theorem of Lebesgue:__ A real valued function $f$ on an open set in locally integrable <=> the set of discontinuities of $f$ has measure $0$
	- Given a subset $T\sub \mathbb{R}^n$ we say that $T$ has measure $0$ if $\forall \epsilon > 0$ contains countably many rectangles $R_1\dots$ such that $T\sub \bigcup R_i$ such that $\sum vol(R) \le \epsilon$
	- Given a subset $T\sub \mathbb{R}^n$ we say that $T$ has content $0$ if $\forall \epsilon > 0$ contains finitely many rectangles $R_1\dots$ such that $T\sub \bigcup R_i$ such that $\sum vol(R) \le \epsilon$
	- __Theorem:__ if $T$ is compact then $T$ has measure $0\iff T$ has content $0$
	- If a bounded set $S\sub \mathbb{R}^n$ is Jordan Measureable if the indicative function $\Chi_S$ is integrable in $\mathbb{R}^n$
	- __Theorem:__ Let $S$ be Jordan Measureable m $g$ is a continuous function on $S$, then $g$ is intgrable on $S$
	- let $S_1,\dots S_n$ be disjoint Jordan measurable sets then $vol(\bigcup S_i) = \sum vol(S_i)$

	- No _Small Little Line Segement_ in the cantor set
	- _You have a mask, I cannot hear anything, anyway it doesn't matter_
	- two sets $A$ and $B$ are __separated__ if $\overline{A} \cap B = \phi$ or $A\cap\overline{B} = \phi$
	- if a space $X$ is connected then the following are equivalent
		- $X$ does not contain any proper clopen subset
		- $X$ does not have a separation
		- $X$ cannot be written as the union of two disjoint proper subsets
	- A metric space is __complete__ if every cauchy sequence in $X$ converges to a point in $X$
	- __Cantor's Intersection Theorem:__ A metric space $(X, d)$ is complete iff the intersection of a contracting sequence of closed sets is exactly one point
	- space $(X, d)$ is a metric space, then the $diam(E) = \sup\{d(x,y):x, y \in E\}$
		- if $E$ is bold the then $diam(E)<\infty$
		- $E<\overline{E}\implies diam{E}<diam(\overline{E})$
	- A sequence is said to be contracting if, as $n \to \infty\implies diam(a_n) \to 0$
- # Category Thoery
	- Category $\mathbb{C} = (Ob(\mathbb{C}), Mor(\mathbb{C}), dom, cat, id, \cdot)$
	- __"Def":__ a category is a directed graph with an associative composition that is locally unital
	- __Functors__ are category "homomorphism"
	- __Functors__ are also diagrams
	- Let $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{D}$ are categories, a <u>functor</u> $F:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{D}$ is the following data:
		- $F_O: Ob(\\mathbb{C}) \to Ob(\mathbb{D})$
		- $F_M: Mor(\mathbb{C}) \to Mor(\mathbb{D})$
		- such that $dom(F_M(f)) = F_O(dom(f))$
		- $cod(F_M(f)) = F_O(cod(f))$
		- $F_M(g\circ f) = F_M(g)\circ F_M(f)$
		- $F_M(id_A) = id_{F_OA}$
	- ### Examples
		- any category to the trivial category
		- Identity functor
		- group homomorphisms
		- Functor that takes a group to the category of categories
		- trivial category to other categories which takes the object to any other object in the category and the identitiy morphism to identity morphism of the object
			- is equivalent to taking the $Ob$ function
		- commutative squares to commutative squares in other categories
		- __Hom functor__
		- __Reverser Hom functor__ aka __Contravariant Hom functor__ is a functor from $\mathbb{C}^{op}$ to Set
		- __Contravariant functor__ from $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}^{op}$
		- Underlying functor from group to set
	- functors are composable, which is composable because composition of set maps is composable
	- A functor from $\mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{D}$ is bijective to $\mathbb{C}^{op}\to\mathbb{D}^{op}$
	- The shape of $J$ in $\mathbb{C}$ is a functor from $J \to \mathbb{C}$
	- __Duality Principle__ there is an isomorphism between the cats to category of cat-ops which implies, if some statement is true in category, then its true in its dual , every theorem has a dual
