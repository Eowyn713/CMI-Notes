- # Question 1
- If $|x - y| < \delta$ such that $x,y \in [1,\infty)$
- $$\begin{aligned}
  |\log(x) - \log(y)| &= \left|\log\left(\frac{x}y\right)\right|\\
  &\le \left|\log\left(\frac{y+\delta}y\right)\right|\\
  &\le \left|\log\left(1+\frac{\delta}{y}\right)\right|\\
  &\le \left|\frac\delta{y}\right|\\
   &\le \delta
  \end{aligned}$$
- Therefore, $\forall \epsilon>0, \exists \delta=\epsilon$ such that $|x-y|<\delta \implies |\log(x)-\log(y)| < \epsilon$
- Hence $\log$ is uniformly continuous in $[1,\infty)$

- # Question 4
- ### a)
	- $S$ is not Jordan Measurable
	- Consider a partition $P_1\times P_2 = P$
	- Since $S$ is dense in $I^2,\ L(P, \chi_S) = 0,\ U(P, \chi_S)=1$ for any partition $P$
	- $\inf L(P, \chi_S)  = 0$
	- $\sup U(P, \chi_S) = 1$
	- hence $X_S$ is not Integrable
- ### b)
	- Since no open balls can be made around any point in $S$ which are a subset of $S$, $S^o = \emptyset$
	- $\overline{S} = I^2$
	- $\delta S = \overline{S}\setminus S^o = I^2$
	- $I^2$ is a closed and bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, hence $I^2$ is compact
	- Since $I^2$ is compact, there exits an open cover with finite subcover $\{R_n}
	- $I^2\sub \bigcup\limits_{1\le i\le n} R_i$
	- $Area(I^2) \le Area\left(\bigcup\limits_{1\le i \le n} R_i\right)$
	- Therefore area of any union of sets that make a cover of $I^2$, hence The jordan measure of $\delta S$ is non zero

- # Question 5
- ### a)
	- $\delta S = \left\{\left(\frac1n, y\right)|n\in \mathbb{N}, y\in I\right\}$
	- The set $\left(\frac1n, y\right)$ for a particulat $n$ can be covered  by the rectangle $I\times \left[\frac1n-\frac\epsilon3,\frac1n+\frac\epsilon3\right]$
	- The area of the cover of the set is $\frac{2\epsilon}3<\epsilon$, hence the has measure $0$
	- countable union of zero measure sets has measure $0$, hence $\delta S$ has measure 0, hence $S$ is Integrable
- ### b)
	- $Area(S) = Area(I^2) - \sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty Area\left(\left[\frac1n+\frac{\epsilon}{2\cdot2^i},\frac1n- \frac{\epsilon}{2\cdot2^i} \right]\right)$
	- $Area(S) = 1 - \epsilon$
	- $Area(S) = 1$

- # Question 6
- Since $f$ is continuous, it is integrable in a closed interval, let $\eta$ be the closed figure which is the union of $\Gamma_f$, and the area enclosed in the curve.
- since $f$ is integrable, we know that $\chi_\eta$ is integrable $\implies\Gamma_f$ is
